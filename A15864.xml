            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <hi>before he hath deepely thought vpon all the actes of the day paſt. As alſo what is paſt, what was done in time, what not? why comelines was wanting in ſuch a deed? or reaſon in another? what eſcaped my ſelfe? why that opinion ſtood, which it had been better for him to chaunge? pitying one, why I felt ſome griefe in a broken heart? why I willed ſomewhat which was not good to will? why my ſelfe being euill, I prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red profit before honestie. Whether any man were hurt by word or by countenaunce? why nature more draweth me, than correction or education? Thus walking as it were through all his wordes and workes, and beginning at the euening, and reuoluing all things, is offended with the euill, and aſcribeth praiſe, and promiſeth and giueth rewards to things well done.</hi>

               <p>Eightly, parents, ſchoolemaſters,<note place="margin">Inferiour perſons of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences, muſt be corrected by the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</note> and elders, yea all Chriſtians indifferently, if they ſee or certainely know, that either their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or ſchollers, or people, or neighbours and fellow brethren, haue offended, this they muſt aſſaie to correct and redreſſe, by al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadging and calling to remembrance the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:27268:81"/> Sermons that were made touching theſe ſins, yea by more ſpeciall and ſtrict applying of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> them to the preſent tranſgreſſion. For ſo they indeed ſhall performe their dutie,<note place="margin">A double profit.</note> while they exerciſe diſcipline, and vſe brotherly admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and corrections, to which all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full are mutually bound one to another, and <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> amongeſt themſelues: and the other ſhall be well inured to beare the cenſure that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen of them, by and from occaſion of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons heard, and ſhall more deepely thinke vpon the Sermons themſelues, and treaſure them vp better in their hearts.</p>
               <p>Theſe things haue I obſerued partly out of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the ſpeeches and conferences of excellent di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines,<note place="margin">The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of this whole treatie.</note> and ſuch other skilfull men in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the Church miniſterie, as I could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed ſee and heare: and partly from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> courſe and experience of mine owne mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, and from the Sermons of my fellow miniſters, and others that I could heare, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſuch things in the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> as I tooke to be worthy either praiſe, or obſeruation, or elſe were to be imitated, or auoided: and laſtly, from the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of other men, touching the making or hearing of Sermons, putting down ſuch things as I thought worthy &amp; meet, both to appoint
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:27268:81"/> and take to mine owne priuate vſe, and alſo publikely to communicate and impart to and with other of my brethren, that runne with me in the ſelfe ſame race.

And ſurely he muſt be <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> more than blind, that perceiueth not by theſe things, how excellent, difficile, and hard a skill and charge it is, both to make &amp; to heare Sermons: as on the other ſide, how much <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> they are out of the way that perſwade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues that they haue in this behalfe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, yea ſufficiently done their duties, if <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> either for an howrs ſpace, obſeruing as it were ſome cuſtome, they coldly deliuer ſome cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine ſpeech to the congregation out of the pulpit; or being hearers, go vnto the holy aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> either to ſpend the time as we ſay, or vpon ſome hypocriticall cuſtome. How much rather, through the grace of almightie God, doth it behoue all the labouring mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the Lords vineyerd, carefully to apply
